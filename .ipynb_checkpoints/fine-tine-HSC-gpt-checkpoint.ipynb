Coastal scrub has thinned out its scraggy imprecision and has become the scraggier, scrubbier buildings of a town he has not entered for twenty years, which yet, as he watches the houses grow larger with approach, fills him with a nauseating nostalgia. \\n\\nHe has kept apart as far as possible from the other passengers all the week, but now, as they join him along the railing, he feels obliged to share the excitement and the chatter. Hands point. Voices cry out. The boat noses its rusty way from harbour to river and river docks. \\n\\nThere are only two others disembarking and he hopes to avoid them, knowing the town is full of pubs. Their reason for return is the same as his and already, conscious of his ambitions for solitariness, he wonders why he has come. His elderly legs wobble on this Friday morning gangplank but they are the same legs that strolled through this town twenty years before, and he marvels that he is experiencing grief when, he supposes, rage would be the better thing. Turning his back firmly on the river and the docks, he walks steadily up the slope past the warehouses and enters the town. \\n\\nThe streets are busy with horses and big drays*. There are people on bicycles bumping along the rough roads. Groggy from all this, he stands uncertain in sunlight, his bag at his feet. One should never go back. He decides this with vehemence and wonders then is he thinking of the psychic mistake of it or his own lack of charity. One does go back, he knows, again and again. One should forgive places as much as people. \\n\\nThis place has much to be forgiven it. \\n\\nTerrible to sense the valetudinarian** legs tentative along the footpath. But up here everyone saunters. He is relieved he does not look remarkable. It is a refusal to fight the heat which already is dealing him blow upon blow; rather a yielding to it. Already steam is rising from the baking township and its slow river. Already there is sweat along his hairline, the saddened back of his neck, trickling between his breasts. \\n\\nHe feels reluctant to face his hotel yet, knowing its drabness already, the tired pots of fern, the bar-stink, the narrow bedroom with its spotted mirror. He walks on one hundred, two hundred yards and finds a tea-shop sluicing out the evening before. Rinsing the last strains of it, a thin girl has been doing penance with mop and bucket. She couldn’t care less about this elderly man with his thin face and thinner voice demanding tea. She isn’t forgiving anybody, refuses the credit of his smile, while slinging her bile across one table surface after the other with a rancid grey rag. \\n\\nBut he tries. \\n\\n‘It’s twenty years,’ he volunteers, ‘since I’ve been here.’ (Where are the banners, the bunting . . .)\\n\\n She deals savagely with the counter and crashes the glass jars of sweets to one side. \\n\\n‘Lucky you,’ she says.\\nAuthor: THEA ASTLEY\\nType: Prose fiction extract\\nQuestion: Analyse how the experience of returning home has been shaped by the writer.\\nMarks: 5'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'Title: i’m bored, therefore i am\\nText: It’s one of the most fundamental human impulses, but boredom is becoming an increasingly endangered species. What’s truly at stake in the war against being bored?\\n\\nIt was a warm and intoxicating summer in 1986 when Christopher Knight, a 20-year-old from the small town of Waltham, Massachusetts, decided to leave home for good. Armed only with a backpack of clothes and a thin nylon tent, Knight drove a hire car deep into the woods, left the keys in the centre console and then seemingly walked right out of existence, no note, no warning, no trace. His family and everyone who knew him assumed he was dead.\\n\\nUntil, that is, the morning of April 4, 2013, when the same Christopher Knight was caught stealing food from a nearby house. When asked why his speech was slurred, Knight explained that the officer who arrested him was the first person he’d spoken to in 27 years. For that entire time he had simply been alone in the forest, a solitary adventurer discovering what mysteries lay on the other side of boredom. “I lost my identity,” Knight would later tell the journalist Michael Finkel. “With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there. There was no need to define myself; I became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn’t even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free.”\\n\\nThere was a time when experiences like Knight’s were, if not commonplace, at least not unheard-of. A time when people felt the pull of boredom and leaned into it, in the hope they’d emerge on the other side. The 2010s are not that time. We are, to put it mildly, at an interesting point in our relationship with ennui*. “We’re certainly less bored than all the people who came before us, just because we have so many options presented to us day after day,” says Mary Mann, author of Yawn: Adventures in Boredom. “To paraphrase the philosopher Bertrand Russell, while we might find ourselves in the position of being bored less often, we are far more scared of it.”\\n\\nOur new post-boredom society is not merely an academic concern. For as long as people have roamed the earth they have been infected and animated by a sense of boredom. That uneasy stirring, the glimmers of anxiety and creeping lassitude** – these are the symptoms of a distinctly human phenomenon, an impulse that has led us out of the caves and into the gleaming megacities of the 21st century. While other animals can exhibit a sense of boredom, it is only humans who transform it into change, exploration, creativity and violence . . .\\n\\nOf course, overstimulation can produce its own listlessness, one that manifests in epidemic rates of anxiety and depression. “Boredom is a challenge,” Mann says, and being challenged is often good for us. “But we’re in a transition now. Watch people communicating and you’ll see the focus they direct to their phones, or the instant, almost violent frustration when their Wi-Fi isn’t working. We have so much anxiety when stimulation is lost for even a second. It’s scary.”\\n\\nIt’s humbling to think of how unrecognisable the world of today must be to the one that Christopher Knight departed three decades ago. It’s a world that has indulged and exaggerated all those aspects of society he once fled: the press of humanity, the everaccelerating need to stimulate and to share our drive for novelty with others. “There isn’t nearly enough nothing in the world anymore,” he told Finkel. “What I miss most is somewhere between quiet and solitude. What I miss most is stillness.”\\n\\nLiving in the wilderness and stealing food to survive is one way to find a little stillness. But going full-Robinson Crusoe isn’t the only solution. Perhaps we need only ask ourselves what we have lost in our haste to drive boredom from our lives, and what we might gain by inviting just a bit of it back in. To turn again to Bertrand Russell: “A generation that cannot endure boredom will be a generation of little men . . . of men in whom every vital impulse slowly withers as though they were cut flowers in a vase.”\\nAuthor: LUKE RYAN\\nType: Feature article\\nQuestion: How does the feature article explore the paradox of boredom?\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

In an essay entitled ‘The Difficulty of Defining Comedy’, Samuel Johnson remarks that though human beings have been wise in many different ways, they have always laughed in the same way, but this is surely doubtful. Laughter is a language with a host of different idioms: cackling, chortling, grunting, chuckling, shrieking, bellowing, screaming, sniggering, gasping, shouting, braying, yelping, snickering, roaring, tittering, hooting, guffawing, snorting, giggling, howling, screeching and so on. It can come in blasts, peals, gales, gusts, ripples or torrents, blaring, trumpeting, trickling, swirling or piercing. There are also different ways of smiling, from beaming, smirking and sneering to grinning, leering and simpering. Smiling is visual and laughter primarily aural . . . In fact, most of the forms of laughter I have just listed have little or nothing to do with humour. Laughter may be a sign of high spirits rather than amusement, though you are more likely to think things funny if you are feeling euphoric in the first place. Physical modes and emotional attitudes can be combined in a variety of ways, so that you can titter nervously or derisively, bray genially or aggressively, giggle with surprise or delight, cackle appreciatively or sardonically and so on.\\nAuthor: TERRY EAGLETON\\nType: Non-fiction extract\\nQuestion: Explain how this text examines the human experience of laughter.\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

He lived amidst thickets of closely growing slender plants with barely anything for leaves, which never gave an ant an inch of shelter under a thousand thorny branches. This foreign infestation on the edge of Desperance grew out of an era long before anyone in the Phantom family could remember . . . \\n\\nThe Pricklebush mob says that Normal Phantom could grab hold of the river in his mind and live with it as his father’s fathers did before him. His ancestors were the river people, who were living with the river from before time began. Normal was like ebbing water; he came and went on the flowing waters of the river right out to the sea. He stayed away on the water as long as he pleased. He knew fish, and was on friendly terms with gropers, the giant codfish of the Gulf sea that swam in schools of fifty or more, on the move right up the river following his boat in for company. The old people say the groper lives for hundreds of years and maybe Normal would too. When he talked about the stars, they said he knew as much about the sky as he did about water. The prickly bush mob said he had always chased the constellations: We watched him as a little boy running off into the night trying to catch stars. They were certain he knew the secret of getting there. They thought he must go right up to the stars in the company of groper fish when it stormed at sea, when the sea and the sky became one, because, otherwise, how could he have come back? \\n\\n“How you do that?” was the question everyone asked. \\n\\n“The water doesn’t worry me,” Normal Phantom answered simply, although he knew that when his mind went for a walk, his body followed. \\n\\nEveryone in Desperance was used to the sight of Normal’s jeep driving north to meet the river’s edge. It was the only vehicle he had ever owned. Always, the small tinnie boat, full of dints, a stray bullet hole or two, strapped onto the roof. A vessel purchased with cross-country road transport in mind, much more than water safety. \\n\\nThey say he knew these deep muddy waters better than the big salties: crocs that got tangled up in the nets in the middle of the night. Glassy-eyed monsters that came over the side of his tiny craft looking for action with the big river man. Jaws charging for a winner-takes-all kind of fight in the swamping boat, snapping in full flight, water splashing up into a storm with the swishing, thrash, thrash, thrashing of an angry tail against the side of the boat. People like to remember Normal saying in melancholy fashion (faking a thoroughly modern Americanised impersonation of a presidential Captain Hook): those snapping jaws meant diddly squat to him. Meanwhile, he moved like a hopping hare, fumbling for what seemed like ages to find the gun. Normal ended hundreds of lives of prehistoric living fossils this way, with his gun pointing all over the place in a turmoil of water and thick leather crankiness, until he made a direct hit between the eyes of the reptile caught in an instant of moonlight. \\n\\nIn this otherwise quietly living population of about three hundred people, no living soul remembered what the port had looked like before. No picture could be put on display in a showcase at the museum of scarce memorabilia, because no one at the time of the heyday thought it was worthwhile to take a photo. But everybody knew that this was Normal’s river.\\nAuthor: ALEXIS WRIGHT\\nType: Prose fiction extract\\nQuestion: Analyse the ways this text represents the relationship between identity and place.\\nMarks: 6'}]},\n",

I sometimes drift into a kind of mental autopilot when hiking here because I’ve experienced it so often. This particular time, however, I found myself looking up into an unfamiliar area about half an hour in, not knowing exactly where I was. It was a simple mistake, I hadn’t been paying enough attention to where I was going, and consequently I veered off the path. When I glanced up and realised the woods did not look as I was expecting them to I felt a rush of exhilaration. The woods became instantaneously new . . . My sense memory was momentarily destabilised, and the resulting experience was a reminder of how the familiar can suddenly appear as new. I’d walked here many times before, and the scent of hung-over raindrops, the sound of gravel, touch of leaves, tree trunks and the sight of falling sunshine diamonds, had picture booked their way into my mind’s eye. But in this moment that eye was suddenly and unexpectedly awakened to a new way of seeing . . . \\n\\nI’ve left out a step. Before I experienced the release of being disoriented, before I surrendered to it, I felt intensely frustrated. I experienced the rigidity of my own consciousness, how instinctively resistant I was to something unexpected. Something was happening in this swirl of frustration; I wasn’t on autopilot any more. I was out of my comfort zone, and I had to participate in that instant, participate in making meaning of my surroundings in order to understand where I was. My mind had been disrupted. I looked up, I looked around, and I felt as if a force was enabling me to see the woods, not just look at them. I experienced an instantaneous transformation of consciousness; a blip in which the latent* enchantment of the everyday world manifested vividly, even if just for a fleeting moment. The woods were the stage, I was the audience, and I experienced the great creative tension of the theatre: severed from my filter of expectation, I temporarily experienced the transformation of my own reality.\\nAuthor: DIDEM CAIA\\nType: Nonfiction extract\\nQuestion: Analyse how Didem Caia uses literary devices to reflect on her experience.\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

No, she will not have any more toast. \\n\\nShe picks up the phone receiver and dials. Everything was ‘marvellous!’ when she was on this phone; a beige thing on the kitchen wall with a long clapped-out curly cord that you had to duck under as she paced and smoked, saying ‘marvellous!’ while giving me the wink, indicating her coffee, or a glass of wine that was out of reach, with a pointed finger and a rolling hand. ‘Just marvellous,’ she might say. \\n\\nOr she talks to me, a girl of eight or nine sitting at the table in a pink cotton dress brought back from America. She involves the dog who waits under the table, like a dog in the movies, for scraps and crumbs. Mostly she speaks to the ceiling, at the place where it meets the wall. Her eyes rove along this line as though looking for ideas up there, or for justice. Yes, that is what she wants. She tucks her face down quickly to light another cigarette. She exhales. \\n\\nThe toast is now fully ignored. The toast is dead to her now. The chair is pushed back, the cigarette stubbed out on the actual plate. After which she gets up and walks away. Someone else will dispose of all that. Because I think I mentioned that my mother was a star.

This extraordinary region is relatively untouched. It’s a region that demonstrates humanity at its best; for that pesky, rapacious* species known as human has actually left this place largely alone except in the noble, light-touch pursuit of scientific inquiry. This gentleman’s agreement is honourable and altruistic** – astonishingly so, in this day and age – and has been respected for 60-odd years. But how much longer can this arrangement be preserved?\\n\\nI’m talking about Antarctica, of course. The vast continent that’s a barometer of human goodness. It shows us that wealthy nations can act with consensus and without greed and selfishness when it comes to valuable land and its resources; it’s actually possible. Because, well, humans. What are they, exactly? An entity looking at us from elsewhere would be hard-pressed to come to any other conclusion: we are killers. Plunderers, predators, polluters. The alpha species of a planet we’ve done untold damage to and continue to destroy for our own selfish appetites.\\n\\nBut the marvellous ice-helmeted land at the end of this Earth arrests this image. It is the continent upon which no human lives permanently; just a handful come and go for the good of science. I visited Antarctica on a trip resupplying Australia’s research bases and it felt as if we were intruders in this wonderland. The scientists treated it as an honour to be working with the singular wildlife.\\n\\nThe animals that greeted us seemed fearless and open and curious because they had no knowledge of what we do; of how dangerous humans are. Animals such as a baby seal with its umbilical cord still attached, snap frozen to its belly, who stared at us with deep, soft brown eyes clear with curiosity and trust. Snow petrels circled our ship, calling and dipping and soaring like angels. Penguins fanned away on the ice, waddling like fast metronomes; on land they peered with voracious curiosity, inching forward, movingly trusting. (We would crawl on our stomachs to observe the wildlife, out of respect, because the animals had never known anything taller than them.) \\n\\n. . . Antarctica’s preservation in its pristine condition has been a glorious feat of global generosity. It shows that the strange, selfinterested species known as human can actually be selfless and bold; it demonstrates the best of our instincts. Let’s keep the continent this way – as a tuning fork for how we want to work with other vulnerably wild regions of our beautiful planet in the long term.\\nAuthor: NIKKI GEMMELL\\nType: Feature article extract\\nQuestion: Explain how Gemmell explores the paradoxes of human behaviour in this extract.\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

Experiential purchases like trips, concerts, movies, et cetera, tend to trump material purchases . . . \\n\\nExperiential purchases are also more associated with identity, connection, and social behavior. Looking back on purchases made, experiences make people happier than do possessions. It’s kind of counter to the logic that if you pay for an experience, like a vacation, it will be over and gone; but if you buy a tangible thing, a couch, at least you’ll have it for a long time. Actually most of us have a pretty intense capacity for tolerance, or hedonic adaptation*, where we stop appreciating things to which we’re constantly exposed. Phones, clothes, couches, et cetera, just become background. They deteriorate or become obsolete. It’s the fleetingness of experiential purchases that endears us to them. Either they’re not around long enough to become imperfect, or they are imperfect, but our memories and stories of them get sweet with time. Even a bad experience becomes a good story. \\n\\nWhen it rains through a beach vacation, as Kumar put it, “People will say, well, you know, we stayed in and we played board games and it was a great family bonding experience or something.” Even if it was negative in the moment, it becomes positive after the fact. That’s a lot harder to do with material purchases because they’re right there in front of you.\\nAuthor: JAMES HAMBLIN\\nType: Feature article extract\\nQuestion: How does Hamblin expand the reader’s understanding of the paradoxes of consumerism?\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

Think of how the contestants describe themselves on any . . . reality TV show: they cannot just be living their lives – they must be overcoming adversity. Nobody describes themselves primarily in terms of their role in society or community; nobody is simply chilling. They are triumphing over [insert hardship real or imagined]; they are just a kid from [whichever state they’re from], trying to make it in the world. They present themselves as being the hero of their own monomyth, currently slogging their way through Act 2 of 3, striving to reach the cathartic denouement when they have slain all the dragons standing between them and success. \\n\\nThe ever-present mark of this infuriating way of speaking is the word ‘journey’.

Their joys are boring; their tragedies are boring; their passions and grudges are boring. But the ubiquity of My Journey makes people think that their lives will become interesting, if only they are shoehorned into this redemptive story of adversity, resilience, hard work and eventual reward. It’s just not so! . . . \\n\\nAnother problem is that, to the extent other people’s lives are interesting, this one-size-fits-all way of talking about them instantly extinguishes anything you might care to hear about. It sands off all the rough edges, all the bits that don’t make sense, the parts where people broke the rules or didn’t get what they expected.

In 1997, he was the only person to be pulled alive from a massive landslide at Thredbo in the Snowy Mountains. 18 people, including his wife Sally, died when two ski lodges were destroyed. Stuart spent 65 hours underground, on the brink of death himself, until his rescue. The experience was so harrowing that it’s tempting to once again embrace magical thinking and assume that Thredbo must have fulfilled Stuart’s lifetime allotment of suffering. Sadly, life had another breathtaking twist in store. In 2015, Stuart’s second  wife,  Rosanna,  died  from  breast  cancer,  leaving  him  alone  with  their  four-year-old daughter Alessia.\\n\\n‘I know people think this,’ Stuart tells me when we meet, ‘they haven’t said it right to me, but they think, Who’s going to sign up to be the third Mrs Diver? I think the same. God, this next person who comes along, they have to deal with all this.’\\n\\nStuart is 47, a strikingly good-looking man with wavy grey hair, a trim physique, and a tanned face that suggests a lot of time spent outdoors. He puts on the jug when I arrive at his cottage in Thredbo and we share tea in his living room. Alessia is outside playing with her cousin but every  inch  of  the  house  shouts  her  presence –toys,  sneakers,  drawings,  and  other  little-girl tchotchkes are scattered everywhere.\\n\\nWhen you read just now that Stuart Diver had lost two wives, did you for a split second think of  some  variation,  \"He  must  be  jinxed?\" If so, that’s your brain humming away involuntarily, trying to impose cause and effect. It’s also yet another example of the way the mind misleads. Stuart Diver is not jinxed, although he has undoubtedly been unlucky. Stuart lost one wife in an incredibly rare, freak event, something for which nobody could possibly blame Stuart Diver himself. Once the landslide was in his past and he remarried, his odds of becoming a widower reset.  Unfortunately,  Stuart  then  had  the  misfortune  to  lose  his  second  wife  to  something comparatively common, breast cancer. For women aged 45-54, breast cancer is the number one killer, annually claiming one life in 4066 in Australia. It was unusual for Stuart Diver to lose his first wife in a landslide but it was sadly ordinary to lose his second to cancer.\\n\\nStuart  has  had  years  of  extensive  professional  counselling  to  retrain  his  brain  so  that  he  can replace the thought of how helpless he has felt. He has learned to substitute memories of Sally’s last moments [in Thredbo] with thoughts of wonderful times from their lives together –a great trip, a fun birthday, some other special occasion. In the corner of his living room is a bicycle that he rides every night, and he likens keeping his mental health on track to keeping physically fit. It’s hard. It requires practice and it takes discipline.\\n\\nWhen I first contemplated approaching Stuart for this book, I was reluctant because I knew he had endured 20 years of unsought fame and that he had recently lost Rosanna. When he got in touch and we talked, he reassured me that there was nothing I could ask him that would cause  \\nhim any further grief, that he had done a huge amount of work to come terms with what had happened to him. \\n\\n‘You’ve had two very big whacks in your life and I’m sure plenty of small ones too. Do you think resilience is a finite pool?’\\n\\n‘No, I think you bounce back,’ Stuart says. ‘I feel more resilient than I ever have. But, the bit that worries me emotionally, if you look at my life, is how much more love do I have to give? Is that a finite resource? I did think that maybe I wouldn’t have another relationship because maybe I’m done.’ Stuart sounds so weary when he says this that I’m in fear of choking up. ‘But there are rewards you get from that emotional involvement with someone going through that. And also from my emotional involvement now with Alessia, the love we have for each other.

He tried to hide his delight when she cooked for them because it upset Babi. It was the one subject that caused trouble between them. Ludek left it alone. He never asked what  was  for  dinner  or  who  was  going  to  cook.  BUT  GOD  he  loved  it  when  Aunty  Mana cooked. Even her vegetables tasted good. Even the carrots. Even the cabbage.\\n\\nBabi said that Aunty Mana was only good because she had worked as a maid in London and she had been taught. ‘No one ever taught me how to cook,’ she said. ‘We had nothing. There wasn’t even anything to cook.’ Aunty Mana never responded when Babi said these things. She just watched her sister, her face serious, her mouth held still. Ludek sat down at the table and Uncle Bill poured him a small glass of beer. Babi gave them both a look, but Ludek picked it up and took a sip anyway. It was like something sour and rotten washing around his mouth. He screwed up his eyes and put the glass down. Everyone laughed. Babi gave him a glass of water and he drank it.\\n\\nAunty Mana put a schnitzel on his plate, some fried potato, and a big scoop of cucumber and cream salad. Ludek watched the cream flood the plate. That was the best thing –the taste of the cream salad mixed with the potato, the cream melting into the crispy schnitzel crumbs. It was all of his favourite foods on one plate and he could barely contain himself. The very second Uncle Bill began to eat, he inhaled his first mouthful.\\n\\nUncle  Bill  had  a  system.  He  ate  everything  evenly  so  that  each  different  food  on  his  plate disappeared at the same rate. This included whatever he was drinking. There was never more of one thing than another, and his last mouthful always included a bit of everything. Ludek had tried to copy this system a few times, but it was no good. What if you got full and you wasted your belly space eating cabbage? You might have to leave a dumpling behind, and someone else might eat it before you found room again. It was better to eat your favourite food first. All of it. Then your second favourite, and then the rest. Ludek ate his schnitzel first, all of it. The adults got two and he got one and there were no more left.\\n\\nLudek had no idea how Babi had gotten so much meat. She was trying her best to get everything for her sister, and the two of them stood in lines and shopped all day, chatting on and on all the while, and Ludek could not stand it if he had to go with them because everything took forever –every shop the same, every line the same –and even if he got a soft drink out of it or an ice-block, it was not worth it. They had run out of toilet paper, and it had been a three-day mission trekking around the streets to try and find some. They had to cut-up newspaper and Uncle Bill said it hurt his arse. He told Ludek it was like going back to ‘the bloody days of rationing.’ Ludek had no idea what that meant. Babi was embarrassed.\\n\\nUncle Bill slipped Ludek his last bit of schnitzel, and Ludek scoffed it down.\\nAuthor: FAVEL PARRETT\\nType: Prose fiction extract\\nQuestion: Explore how the extract represents the significance of this family sharing a meal together.\\nMarks: 3'}]},\n",

In fact, this is one of the biggest myths of vulnerability. We’ve found that across cultures, most of us were raised to believe that being vulnerable is being weak.

But not all book browsing trips include a specific shopping list. Many times, the fun is in finding something new.\\n\\nAs independent bookstores pivot to online sales, some are continuing to surprise readers by offering “mystery bags” of books. For between roughly $15 and $100, depending on the store and size of the trove, buyers can request a mix of their favorite genre or titles chosen by the seller.\\n\\nCapitol Hill Booksin Washington, D.C. began offering the service in mid-March at a customer’s request.\\n\\n“Favorite email of the day so far: ‘If I give you guys $100 can you send me a mystery bag of books?’” the bookstore tweeted on March 21. “Yes. Yes we can.”\\n\\nBy the next day, more than 50 people had contacted the store with similar orders, according to Mary Tyler March of WAMU. Prior to the mystery bag suggestion, Capitol Hill Books had essentially closed its doors, limiting opening hours to 60-minute slots in which four people at a time were allowed to wander the store’s narrow, book-lined aisles.\\n\\nMore recently, the shop has been sharing customers’ photos of their mystery book hauls. One patron’s six-book bag featured Wolf Hall, The Vineyard and Career of Evil; another customer’s stack of ten included Aristotle’s Politics and Ernest Hemingway’s The Nick Adams Stories.\\n\\n“It’s been stressful and we’ve had to think on our feet and adapt. Everything changes every day,” Kyle Burk, one of Capitol Hill Books’ owners, told WAMU last month. “We’re really grateful for everyone’s support. People that reach out are making a huge difference right now.”Trident Booksellers and Caféin Boulder, Colorado, began offering a similar service in late March, reports Micah Ling for Atlas Obscura. Trident is the oldest café on Boulder’s downtown Pearl Street, but without foot traffic from locals and University of Colorado students, its owners have had to pivot the business online. The store delivers local orders placed online by bike. These mystery bags include not just books, but a packet of coffee or tea.\\n\\nBy early April, the store had sold more than 300 bags, half of which were sent by mail to locations around the world. The store has run out of science fiction titles to share, and certain specific requests have become difficult to fill.\\n\\n“Keeping up with demand is something we haven’t been used to,” Trident co-owner Andrew Hyde says to Atlas Obscura. “We ran out of delivery bags and coffee bags. Then we ran out of shipping envelopes three times.”\\n\\nBut, he adds, “It’s so much fun to pick great books for people. Lots of obscure things.”\\n\\nMelinda Jones, owner of Second Read Booksin Decatur, Alabama, also started offering mystery bags after reading about a D.C. bookstore’s success with the idea, reports Michael Wetzel for the Decatur Daily. Like Trident, Jones has had a mix of orders from local buyers and individuals from across or outside of the state.\\n\\n“A $25 mystery bag, for example, the buyer will receive probably four or five books of their favorite genre,” Jones tells the Decatur Daily. “It’s working very well. Last week, we sold about 125 mystery bags.”\\nAuthor: THERESA MACHEMER\\nType: Non-fiction extract\\nQuestion: Analyse how Mamecher represents literature as a valuable aspect of the human experience.\\nMarks: 3'}]},\n",

My mother said that we should, that children were a good thing. At the time, I had agreed. But what I really wanted to say was that we talked about it often, while cooking dinner or walking to the shops or making coffee. We talked about every aspect over and over, each of us adding tiny life-like details, or going over hundreds of different possibilities, like physicists in endless conjecture. How hurtful would we be when we were both exhausted and sleep-deprived? How would we go for money? How would we stay fulfilled while at the same time caring so completely for another? \\n\\nWe asked our friends, all of whom were frank and honest. Some of them said that it was possible to find a way through, especially as their children got older. Others said that all the weakest points of our relationship would be laid bare. Others, still, said that it was a euphoric experience, if only you surrendered yourself to it. And yet, really, these thoughtful offerings meant nothing, because it was impossible, ultimately, to compare one life to another, and we always ended up essentially in the same place where we had begun. I wondered if my mother had ever asked these questions, if she’d ever had the luxury of them. I had never particularly wanted children, but somehow I felt the possibility of it now, as lovely and elusive as a poem. Another part of me wondered if it was okay either way, not to know, not be sure. That I could let life happen to me in a sense, and that perhaps this was the deeper truth all along, that we controlled nothing and no one, though really I didn’t know that either.\\nAuthor: JESSICA AU\\nType: Prose fiction extract\\nQuestion: How does Au explore the complex nature of relationships as a human experience?\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'Title: From The Guardian\\nText: It’s a cliche to claim that a novel can change your life, but a recent study suggests almost a\\nfifth of readers report that fiction seeps into their daily existence.\\n\\n\\nResearchers at Durham University conducted a survey of more than 1,500 readers, With about 400 providing detailed descriptions of their experiences with books. Nineteen per\\ncent of those respondents said the voices of fictional characters stayed with them even\\nwhen they weren’t reading, influencing the style and tone of their thoughts – or even\\nspeaking to them directly. For some participants it was as if a character “had started to\\nnarrate my world”, while others heard characters talking, or imagined them reacting to\\nthings going on in everyday life.\\n\\n\\nAccording to one of the paper’s authors, the writer and psychologist Charles Fernyhough,\\nthe survey illustrates how readers of fiction are doing more than just processing words for\\nmeaning – they are actively recreating the worlds and characters being described. “For\\nmany of us, this can involve experiencing the characters in a novel as people we can interact\\nwith,” Fernyhough said. “One in seven of our respondents, for example, said they heard the\\nvoices of fictional characters as clearly as if there was someone in the room with them.”\\n\\n\\nWhen they asked readers to describe what was happening in detail, the researchers found\\npeople who described fictional characters remaining active in their minds after they had put\\nthe book down, and influencing their thoughts as they went about their daily business – a\\nphenomenon Fernyhough called “experiential crossing”.\\n\\n\\nThe term covers a wide range of experiences, from hearing a character’s voice to feeling\\none’s own thoughts shaped by a character’s ideas, sensibility or presence, he continued.\\n“One respondent, for example, described ‘feeling enveloped’ by [Virginia Woolf’s] character\\nClarissa Dalloway – hearing her voice and imagining her response to particular situations,\\nsuch as walking into a Starbucks. Sometimes the experience seemed to be triggered by\\nentering a real-world setting similar to one in the novel; in other situations, it felt like seeing\\nthe world through a particular character’s eyes, and judging events as the character would.”\\nThe characters who make the leap into readers’ lives are typically ‘powerful, vivid characters\\nand narrators’, Fernyhough added.\\n\\n\\nIt’s an experience that the writer recognises from his own reading of Virginia Woolf and\\ncontemporary authors such as Richard Powers and Ali Smith. “Some of my most powerful\\nreading experiences come when I feel that the author has tinkered with the software of my\\nown brain,” he said. “I know I’m in the presence of a great author if she or he makes me\\nnotice things I wouldn’t otherwise have noticed, because the voice and sensibility on the\\npage is sharpening my attention and bringing details into the light, and because I’m starting\\nto think like them.”\\n\\n\\nThe results struck a chord with the novelist Edward Docx, who recalled reading JD Salinger’s\\nThe Catcher in the Rye as a teenager. “I fell very heavily under the influence of Holden\\nCaulfield,” Docx said. “I think a lot of people do. The way that Salinger writes, which is so intelligent and literate and insightful and – for want of a better word – cool, was very\\ninfluential.” A dissenting, sardonic voice from the US was very attractive for someone\\ngrowing up in the UK, he continued. “It was definitely in my head. It gave me a way of\\nthinking and of being that wasn’t available in my immediate circumstances.”\\n\\n\\nAccording to Docx, fiction’s ability to let readers participate in lives other than their own is\\nthe thing that sets it apart from other art forms. “It gives you the interiority of characters’\\nminds,” he explained. “The greatest film can’t do that, and neither can a computer game.\\nOnly the novel can give you an intimate portrait of the complex cross-currents of human\\npsychology, to the extent where you know another person’s soul. And that’s the most\\nintimate thing in the world.”\\n\\n\\nFor Fernyhough, creating a character who can touch readers is a real accomplishment.\\nWriting a novel whose characters can escape into the real world does feel “a bit like writing\\nsoftware,” Fernyhough continued. “Or laying a minefield for the heart. You want to shape\\nhow your readers think and feel – not in prescriptive ways that leave them no room to bring\\ntheir own experiences and interpretations, but to allow them to enter the minds of people\\nthey are not, and to have something of their experiences.”\\n\\n\\nDocx compared the characters whose voices get into readers’ heads to secret friends. “You\\nwish you were great pals with Holden Caulfield, that you could sit around and trade\\nwisecracks with him,” he said. “Obviously it’s a form of madness, but then all fiction is a\\nform of madness.”\\nAuthor: RICHARD LEA\\nType: Feature article\\nQuestion: How does the extract challenge assumptions and ignite new ideas about reading fiction?\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

But we just tum our heads, he and I, making eye contact, feeling each other's presence the best we can, as long and as close as we dare. \\n\\nSo how does it  feel to be face to face with a creature whose heart is  several times bigger than your own body, whose eye is curious and watchful and whose intelligence is palpable? Despite how many times I've done this before, the experience feels ... well, it feels holy. Yes, it  feels sacred. It's a privilege, a joy. It's like being 10 years old again and realising the world around you is a living miracle. A meeting like this renews my spirit; it makes me glad to be alive.\\nAuthor: TIM WINTON\\nType: Feature article extract\\nQuestion: Explain how Tim Winton conveys his emotional response to viewing the whale calf.\\nMarks: 3\"}]},\n",

She was an artist, a transient and a gleaner**, who lived on the streets when she wasn’t in rehab, and the address she used to get her library card belonged to a local shelter. The pseudonym, her nom de guerre, made some kind of sense. \\n\\nShe was infamous among the librarians for an unauthorized site-specific installation she had done a year earlier, consisting of labyrinthine trails that led through the Library’s collection. She called it ‘Forking paths”.  \\n\\nWhile some of the librarians objected to finding odd things stuck in the books, Cory always felt a little thrill when she stumbled across the girl’s strange scraps and leavings. They were like clues in a treasure hunt: cryptic notes, postcards, gum wrappers, faded Polaroids, pressed flowers, movie tickets, job ads and more. At first glance they seemed random and accidental, and yet you could sense a subtle, underlying pattern, too, a narrative determination or sense of purpose that was controlling the choice of this book over that one. \\n\\nCory has never actually followed any of the trails from beginning to end-assuming there was a beginning or an end- but she was intrigued. The paths held the promise of a journey being undertaken or meaning being made. Once she found a slip of paper in handwriting made to look like typewriter font, tucked inside an old edition of Grimm’s Fairy Tales. She re-shelved the book, and later, when she went back to look for it, she found someone had taken it out.

       "    'content': 'Title: Any Ordinary Day\\nText: The day that turns a life upside down usually starts like any other. You open your eyes, swing your body out of bed, eat breakfast, get dressed and leave the house, your mind busy. As you close the front door behind you, rarely is there a tingle of Unease that something is off. Later, when the story of what happened next comes to be told, it will start with the day’s deceptive ordinariness, something that will now seem incredible. How could a blindside so momentous have struck on a day that began so unremar Kably?\\n\\n\\nIn late 2014, the news media was dominated by two such days, so unimaginable in their endings that they rattled even those of us far removed from the events. On the afternoon of November 25, a sparkling spring day, a young cricketer, Phillip Hughes, was fatally struck by a ball during a game. And on December 15, at morning tea time in a Sydney café, a gunman took eighteen people hostage, two of them – Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson – killed by the siege’s end.\\n\\n\\nPhillip Hughes had padded up as he’d done since childhood. Katrina Dawson had left her law office and popped downstairs for a hot chocolate. Tori Johnson had gone about his business on a regular day at work. Where was the last sign to exit the freeway, the chance to change course? It feels\\nas if the universe cheated them by not warning that this was a day to stay home. If the universe –\\nor fate, luck, God, happenstance, whatever you want to call it – didn’t give them that courtesy, then it probably won’t offer it to you or me either.\\n\\n\\nThere are choices we all make in the full knowledge that they will alter the course of our lives: whether to marry or have children or change jobs. We expect such decisions to have consequences. The confronting thing about the cricket accident and the Lindt siege is that the choices leading to disaster were so minor they would have been barely worth contemplation. What family could imagine that sending their boy to cricket instead of soccer is a decision about how long he will live? Who could possibly function wondering each day if a decision about sharing a hot drink with a friend was a matter of life or death? We all make similar choices without pause every moment of every day, blessedly oblivious to where they might lead. \\n\\n\\nThere’s no way to stop the clandestine forces, marshalled by insignificant decisions, that will clash in a future instant. Some will have been on their trajectories for years, others for minutes. They level the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful, without discrimination. It’s straightforward to grasp this intellectually, but deeply emotionally uncomfortable to be prodded with the sharpness of the reality. The events in the news in late 2014 magnified the deepest truth of being alive, a fact that is both wonderful and terrible all at once – we never know what is coming next.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nI’m sure I’m not the only person to watch something awful on the news and think, That could have been me. But what is the actual chance that you or I could be swept up in a tragic event of the kind that makes headlines and permanently transforms our lives?\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nBut when we look at the facts, not just our feelings, what are the genuine odds of an awful, random event ensnaring us individually? And are the things we most fear happening to us the things of which we should be most afraid?\\nAuthor: LEIGH SALES\\nType: Non-fiction extract\\nQuestion: How does Leigh Sales invite us to reflect on the inconsistencies of our everyday human experiences?\\nMarks: 4'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'Title: The Narrow Road to the Deep North\\nText: Dorrigo was the only one of his family to pass the Ability Test at the end of his schooling at the age of twelve and so receive a scholarship to attend Launceston High School. He was old for his year. On his first day, at lunchtime, he ended up at what was called the top yard, a flat area of dead grass and dust, bark and leaves, with several large gum trees at one end. He watched the big boys of third and fourth form, some with sideburns, boys already with men’s muscles, line up in two rough rows, jostling, shoving, moving like some tribal dance. Then began the magic of kick to kick. One boy would boot the football from his row across the yard to the other row. And all the boys in that row would run together at the ball and—if it were coming in high—leap into the air, seeking to catch it. And as violent as the fight for the mark was, whoever succeeded was suddenly sacrosanct*. And to him, the spoil—the reward of kicking the ball back to the other row, where the process was repeated.\\n\\nSo it went, all lunch hour. Inevitably, the senior boys dominated, taking the most marks, getting the most kicks. Some younger boys got a few marks and kicks, many one or none.\\n\\nDorrigo watched all that first lunchtime. Another first-form boy told him that you had to be at least in second form before you had a chance in kick to kick—the big boys were too strong and too fast; they would think nothing of putting an elbow into a head, a fist into a face, a knee in the back to rid themselves of an opponent. Dorrigo noticed some smaller boys hanging around behind the pack, a few paces back, ready to scavenge the occasional kick that went too high, lofting over the scrum.\\n\\nOn the second day, he joined their number. And on the third day, he found himself up close to the back of the pack when, over their shoulders, he saw a wobbly drop punt lofting high towards them. For a moment it sat in the sun, and he understood that the ball was his to pluck. He could smell the piss ants in the eucalypts, feel the ropy shadows of their branches fall away as he began running forward into the pack. Time slowed, he found all the space he needed in the crowding spot into which the biggest, strongest boys were now rushing. He understood the ball dangling from the sun was his and all he had to do was rise. His eyes were only for the ball, but he sensed he would not make it running at the speed he was, and so he leapt, his feet finding the back of one boy, his knees the shoulders of another and so he climbed into the full dazzle of the sun, above all the other boys. At the apex of their struggle, his arms stretched out high above him, he felt the ball arrive in his hands, and he knew he could now begin to fall out of the sun.\\n\\nCradling the football with tight hands, he landed on his back so hard it shot most of the breath out of him. Grabbing barking breaths, he got to his feet and stood there in the light, holding the oval ball, readying himself to now join a larger world.\\n\\nAs he staggered back, the melee cleared a respectful space around him. Who the fuck are you? asked one big boy.\\n\\nDorrigo Evans.That was a blinder, Dorrigo. Your kick.\\n\\nThe smell of eucalypt bark, the bold, blue light of the Tasmanian midday, so sharp he had to squint hard to stop it slicing his eyes, the heat of the sun on his taut skin, the hard, short shadows of the others, the sense of standing on a threshold, of joyfully entering a new universe while your old still remained knowable and holdable and not yet lost—all these things he was aware of, as he was of the hot dust, the sweat of the other boys, the laughter, the strange pure joy of being with others.\\n\\nKick it! he heard someone yell. Kick the fucker before the bell rings and it’s all over.And in the deepest recesses of his being, Dorrigo Evans understood that all his life had been a journeying to this point when he had for a moment flown into the sun and would now be journeying away from it forever after. Nothing would ever be as real to him. Life never had such meaning again.\\nAuthor: RICHARD FLANAGAN\\nType: Prose fiction extract\\nQuestion: Explain how Richard Flanagan uses storytelling to showcase contrasting emotions of insecurity and triumph.\\nMarks: 5'}]},\n",

       "    'content': \"Title: From Am I Black Enough For You\\nText: When   I   was   young,   I   never   thought   about   how   my   Catholicism   might   contradict   my   Aboriginality.  I  had  always  thought  you  could  be  both,  because  I  was  both,  and  so  is  Mum.  I  went   through   all   the   sacraments:   baptism,   reconciliation,   first   communion,   irregularconfessions   and   confirmation.   My   confirmation   name   is   Bernardine,   after   my   sponsor,   someone  who's  known  me  since  birth  and  I  call  cousin  because  her  Austrian  father  and  my  father  were  mates  when  they  dated  our  mothers,  who  are  now  best  friends.  We  grew  uptogether  and  are  close  like  sisters;  we  hang  out  together  but  neither  of  us  goes  to  church  anymore. But as a child, Catholicism was just part of my life, and I did as I was told. I'd never learned about the spiritual practices of my ancestors, and only when I was an undergraduate at university, spending four years with mostly Aboriginal students, did I start to question a lot of things, including my religious faith.\\n\\nOddly  enough,  it  was  a  comment  by  a  non-Aboriginal  student  from  my  University  of  New  South Wales  History  tutorial  that  got  me  seriously  thinking.  At  the  end  of  the  semester,  they  wrote  in  my  autograph  book:  'My  friend  Anita,  Aboriginal  AND  Catholic,  I  didn't  think  it  was  possible.'  After  this,  I  stopped  going  to  church  and  started  wondering  how  indeed  it  was  possible  to  be  both.  Eventually,  I  understood  that  I'd  be  practising  my  own  culture  and  spirituality  if  it  weren't  for  the  missionaries  who  Christianised  Aboriginal  people.  I've  never  really acknowledged being a Catholic since or practised Catholicism, although I appreciate the moral codes I grew up with in the Catholic education system.\\n\\nMy  mum,  on  the  other  hand,  has  managed  to  marry  both  her  Aboriginal  spirituality  and  history with her Catholic faith. She's met two popes, dined at the Vatican and has been a long-serving  member  of  the  National  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  Catholic  Council.  In  2010  she  was  awarded  an  honorary  Doctorate  of  Arts  from  the  University  of  Notre  Dame,  Sydney,  for  her  contribution  to  the  Catholic  community.  In 2009  she  was  awarded  (jointly  with Doris Eaton) NAIDOC Female Elder of the Year, partly because of her work in the church. Mum has so much faith in God she even prays to him asking that one day I'll find a husband! She  told  me  once  the  students  at  Nungalinya  College  in  the  NT,  where  she  was  doing  her Diploma of Theology, prayed for me also. But to date, God has not delivered said husband.\\n\\nMum says that my grandparents - also fiercely Catholic - believed that spirituality was the basis  of  our  connection  to  land,  identity,  culture  and  community.  By  this she  means  that  we  can have a strong sense of country, place, family and self, while still valuing, appreciating and living by the teachings of the Bible.\\nAuthor: ANITA HEISS\\nType: Non-fiction extract\\nQuestion: Analyse how Heiss reflects on the complex relationship between culture and identity.\\nMarks: 5\"}]}]"
